A collaborative Software Engineering project to construct a personal website for BU professors

This project was implemented using a model-view-controller style to create a personalized website for professors based on database information provided. The project featured coding in HTML, PHP, JavaScript, and CSS to produce the website. We were grouped together in groups of four and met the professor who acted as a client to present the progress we were making each week for the duration of the project. This is only partial code for the project.
